Skeleton athletes are largely self-funded. Outside of my training (which is itself a fulltime commitment), I work two  jobs to help cover the cost of training, travel, and equipment expenses.

Any donations *will greatly contribute to my success* as an athlete, and towards my goal of competing in the 2018 Olympic Games. I'm currently running a RallyMe campaign, and I would be honored if you would consider contributing.
