Hi I'm Morgan Tracey. I'm the youngest of 5 children, born and raised in Champion, Ohio. I'm also the only girl. Whether good or bad, my older brothers made me into the woman I am today -- tough and tenacious. Never backing down from a challenge, I had my heart set on getting a soccer scholarship and becoming an attorney. I accomplished both, but as usual, *on my own terms*.

Upon graduation from Mercyhurst College in Erie, PA, I knew I wanted to give back. Rather than spending the weekends volunteering, I jumped in headfirst and spent 10 months as a corps member in AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps. I built homes for low income families in Blythe, CA. I worked on fire safety with the United States Forest Service in Pollock Pines, CA. While in Astoria, OR, my team worked with Clatsop Community Action to restore a historic building for community use. I prepared taxes for the Voluntary Income Tax Assistance program in Phoenix, AZ and with the Boys and Girls Club in Pasadena, CA.

After AmeriCorps I spent summers working with the Forest Service as a wildland firefighter and a senior firefighter on the Eldorado Interagency Hotshot Crew, (one of a few elite wildland firefighting squads), where I was the only girl on the crew. In the winters, I went to law school and in 2010 passed the bar exam.

Most recently, I was invited to the White House by President Obama and honored as a Champion of Change for commitment to national service. Now, I am part of the United States National Skeleton Program, with my sights on Pyeongchang, South Korea.
