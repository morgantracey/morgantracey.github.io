Welcome to my little site where I hope to keep my friends, family, and those random people who search the internet late at night updated on my latest adventure, the pursuit of my Olympic Dream. I realize most people donâ€™t know much about the sport of skeleton but it is a really great sport that I hope to be able to share with those of you interested or bored enough to visit my site. Thanks for visiting and check back for my next post where I tell the story of how after seven years of school, five years of fighting fire and one bar exam later I decided to pursue my Olympic Dream.
