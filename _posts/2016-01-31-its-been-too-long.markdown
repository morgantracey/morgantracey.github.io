Hello world! Sometimes life, and the season gets crazy and I forget to update this site. Sorry! I promise I'll give an update soon. Until then, here some pictures from the season so far. Thank you to all of the incredibly talented photographers who grin and bear the cold for these shots. The shots below were taken by Ron Lebanc. Ron is an avid bobsled/skeleton fan who travels North America for these perfect shots. Thanks so much Ron! ![skeleton ron deblanc](/uploads/skeleton ron deblanc.jpg) ![skeleton usa](/uploads/skeleton usa.jpg) ![skeleton ron leblanc](/uploads/skeleton ron leblanc.jpg)
