# Skeleton

Skeleton is an intentionally simple base Jekyll theme. Its minimal design is suitable for customization while remaining content-focused.

## Quick-Start

### Fork the theme
Fork the theme and rename the repo to **username.github.io**, replacing *username* with your GitHub username. This will create a [GitHub User Page](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) that should be instantly viewable at the url *username.github.io*. If you are hosting more than one site, you will need to use a GitHub Project Page instead. Rename the repo and create a `gh-pages` branch off `master`. 

### Customize the site
See the tips below for customizing your install. 

## Installation

Clone the repository:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/kyletress/skeleton.git
~~~

The theme includes `ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` files for RVM. `ruby 2.1.7` is recommended.

Run bundle:

~~~
bundle install
~~~

This installs the `github-pages` gem, which will mimic the GitHub Pages environment.

Start the Jekyll server:

~~~
jekyll serve --watch
~~~

## Customization
Skeleton tries to be as customizable as possible, while remaining true to its simple, content-focused design. To begin, edit `_config.yml`. To customize, look at the following files: 

**_config.yml**: This is your site-wide jekyll configuration file. Use this to set the site title, description, and variables such as whether to show social links in your footer. 

**_data**: The data folder contains settings for navigation, individual authors, and social media profiles. *Note:* The `social.yml` should be used for site-wide social media settings, whereas the social media settings under the `author.yml` file should be used for individual author social media profiles. This is an important distinction for multi-author sites. 

**sass/_variables.scss**: This is where you customize the style of your site. There are tons of variables here to experiment with and adjust. 

## Updating the theme 
I'll occasionally update the theme with bug fixes, improvements, and new features. To update: 

Add a remote that points back to this repo. The convention is to name it `upstream`, but use a name that's meaningful to you.
~~~
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyletress/skeleton.git
~~~
Fetch changes
~~~
git fetch upstream
~~~
Merge the changes
~~~
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
~~~
Fix conflicts and deploy
