# Skeleton

Skeleton is an intentionally simple base Jekyll theme. Its minimal design is suitable for customization while remaining content-focused.

## Quick-Start

### Fork the theme
Fork the theme and rename the repo to **username.github.io**, replacing *username* with your GitHub username. This will create a [GitHub User Page](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) that should be instantly viewable at the url *username.github.io*. If you are hosting more than one site, you will need to use a [GitHub Project Page] instead. Rename the repo and create a `gh-pages` branch off `master`. 

### Customize the site
Open `_config.yml` and edit the variables to fit your design. Edit your navigation and personal information in the `_data` folder. 

## Installation

Clone the repository:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/kyletress/skeleton.git
~~~

The theme includes `ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` files for RVM. `ruby 2.1.7` is recommended.

Run bundle:

~~~
bundle install
~~~

This installs the `github-pages` gem, which will mimic the GitHub Pages environment.

Start the Jekyll server:

~~~
jekyll serve --watch
~~~

## Customization

Coming soon.

## Updating the theme 
I'll occasionally update the theme with bug fixes, improvements, and new features. To update: 

If you forked the repo: 

Change into the directory and run `git fetch upstream`. Next check out the master branch and run `git merge upstream/master` to pull in theme updates. Fix merge conflicts (if any) and publish.

If you cloned the repo:

Add an `upstream` branch to your git repo. 
~~~
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyletress/skeleton.git
~~~
Fetch changes
~~~
git fetch upstream
~~~
Merge the changes
~~~
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
~~~
Fix conflicts and deploy
