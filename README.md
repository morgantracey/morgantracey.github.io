# Skeleton

Skeleton is an intentionally simple base Jekyll theme. Its minimal design is suitable for customization while remaining content-focused.

## Quick-Start

### Fork the theme
Fork the theme and rename the repo to **username.github.io**, replacing *username* with your GitHub username. This will create a [GitHub User Page]() that should be instantly viewable at the url *username.github.io*. If you are hosting more than one site, you will need to use a [GitHub Project Page] instead. Rename the repo and create a `gh-pages` branch off `master`. 

### Customize the site
Open `_config.yml` and edit the variables to fit your design.  

## Installation

Clone the repository:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/kyletress/skeleton.git
~~~

The theme includes `ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` files for RVM. `ruby 2.1.7` is recommended.

Run bundle:

~~~
bundle install
~~~

This installs the `github-pages` gem, which will mimic the GitHub Pages environment.

Start the Jekyll server:

~~~
jekyll serve --watch
~~~

## Customization

Coming soon.
